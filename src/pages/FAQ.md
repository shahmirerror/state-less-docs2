# FAQ

Here are answers to questions you might have, as well as frequently asked questions.  


> Is there a recommended way to handle authentication and authorization in React Server?
  
Authentication and Authorization is currently seamless with Google Oauth. Read more about [authentication](/authentication).

> How can I create custom scopes for managing state, and are there any best practices for doing so?
  
You can pass any string as scope. There is currently no way to define special scopes that have there value replaced during runtime. You can however compute a string dynamically.

> Can you provide more examples of using atomic states once the feature is implemented?

Atomic states will be defined using an equation in the form x=n+1 which allows React Server to infer the correct operation. This feature will be implemented after release. The docs will be updated.

> How do you handle server-side rendering and SEO optimization with React Server?

There is currently no implementation for server side rendering. You can render React components to html, but there is currently no http server serving rendered components. There's also no optimization to pass serverside state to SSR react components.

> Are there any performance considerations or limitations when using React Server, especially when dealing with a large number of users and components?

The architecture has only been tested in small to medium projects where it performed well. So there's currently no limit to performance.

> How do you handle error boundaries and fallback UIs when a component fails to render or encounters an error?

If a component fails to render during a client side request, the error will be passed to the client and can be handled in the frontend. 

> Is there any built-in support for handling component caching, and if so, how can it be configured?

Any stateful server can cache components by using an in memory Store.

> How can I implement real-time functionality or web sockets with React Server?

Every state / component is automatically transported in real-time using  Graph Ql subscriptions. You don't need to worry about it.
