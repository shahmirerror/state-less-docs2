# A component driven, reactive, fullstack framework

React Server is a new framework for building reactive fullstack services. It comes with the familiar syntax of [React](https://react.dev/), our beloved frontend framework.

It allows you to build serverside components using JSX/TSX which combines declarative components with a reactive lifecycle. A coding style known from the frontend library React. (components, hooks, effects etc.)

- With TSX on the Serverside, you can adapt Reacts component driven appraoch to build reactive backend services.
- It uses GraphQl under the hood which provides a reliable transport and modern API interface.
- React Server uses pub / sub to provide realtime state updates which keeps all your clients in sync.
- The modular and component based approach let's you grow your own ecosystem of reusable components which run on any react server instance.

**Go ahead and try React Server. It's easy and fast to prototype sopthisticated services with minimal overhead.**
