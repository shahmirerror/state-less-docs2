# Build modular and reactive fullstack applications with React Server

React Server is a new framework for building server-side applications. It comes with the familiar syntax of [React](https://react.dev/), a beloved frontend framework. 

React Server allows you to build serverside components using JSX/TSX along with a reactive coding style known from the frontend library React. (components, hooks, effects etc.)

* With TSX on the Serverside, you can adapt Reacts component driven appraoch to build reactive backend services.
* It uses GraphQl under the hood which provides a reliable transport and modern API interface. 
* React Server uses pub / sub to provide realtime state updates which keeps all your clients in sync.
* The modular and component based approach let's you grow your own ecosystem of reusable components which run on any react server instance.
