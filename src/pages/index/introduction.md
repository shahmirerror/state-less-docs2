# Build scalable, modular and reactive web applications with React Server

React Server is a full-stack framework that allows you to rapidly prototype modern web applications. 

* With TSX on the Serverside, you can adapt Reacts component driven appraoch to build reactive backend services.
* It's built with GraphQl to provide a reliable transport and modern API interface. 
* React Server uses pub / sub to provide realtime state updates which keeps all your clients in sync.
* Once implemented, React Server can run on a state-less infrastructure like AWS Lambda by externalizing states into a database.
* Build your own ecosystem of reusable backend components that can be dropped into any React Server instance. 

**Try React Server today and see how it can transform the way you build web applications.**
