# Why?

## Because it's beautiful ðŸ¥°

Just like React, it's a new way to code. A _reactive_ approach mitigates so many of the problems JavaScript's asynchronous and event based nature. The beauty lies within the simplicity of semantic flow through your application.

It abstracts complex state interactions and asynchronous operations into a _semantically_ linear (top down) flow of data through your application.

It provides readability which in turn makes your code much more maintainable. The goal of every good codebase should be being able to be read like a book.

It's composable and seperates concerns into self contained components. This provides modularity which in turn decreases the complexity of your architecture and naturally favors a _DRY_ coding style by representing a service as collection of states and operations.

Following these principles allows you to rapidly prototype complex and sophisticated fullstack services while maintaining a readable and robust codebase.

Components are usually small and can be seen as self contained microservices which contain the backend business logic, a database connection and a frontend component which consumes the serverside component providing a user interface to interact with the state of a component through its operations.

It just makes sense to represent operations on states through an external user by a component.

Using TSX as syntactic sugar to represent a component visually drastically improves readability and decreases file size favoring small components and easily skimmable code without sacrificing any flexibility of the host language.

You can use everything JavaSciprt has to offer. React Server just provides a _reactive_ interface which seamlessly integrates with the already existing frontend framework React.

<sub>_Note: It's currently not really usable without React unless you would want to write the client logic again. However you could always speak with the GraphQL API without the need to use the `react-client` library._</sub>

## Reactive Coding

React Server provides an abstraction layer for the asynchronous flow of stateful requests through a _reactive_ interface. It externalizes states into databases, enabling a **stateless** architecture which can be run on e.g. AWS Lambda.
By utilizing a _reactive_ coding style featuring _hooks_ such as `useState` and server / client effects e.g. `useEffect` and `useClientEffect` as know from React, React Server provides a reactive interface with a linear semantic flow of code which abstracts the complex data fetching and transportation logic on the server side. It uses GraphQL's PubSub mechanism allowing you to reflect the serverside state of a component on the client in realtime, simply by consuming a _component_ on the frontend.

The reactive nature of _React Server_ theorethically allows you to minimize TTFB as a cached response will be fetched from the server and once the live data has been fetched from the database it publishes the data to all connected clients, making it available on the frontend as soon as it arrived from the database at the backend.

The benefits of a reactive coding style allow for a clean representation of code flow abstracting complex data fetching and transportation logic promoting readable and maintainable code bases.

## A new way to consume data.

Just like _GraphQL_ provides a new layer of flexibility over REST by allowing you to consume safely typed shapes of data, _React Server_ provides a new layer above GraphQL which allows you to consume _components_ instead of an arbitrary shape. Which of course is way less flexible than consuming custom shapes. However in the context of component based _micro services_ where you already modularize your frontend code into reusable components you can couple these to backend component which provide full server authoritative backend buisiness logic for your frontend components. This allows you to craft highly reusabel microservices which can be hosted on any NodeJS runtime which supports _React Server_. The neat part is that communication between the server and client is seamless. You can obtain _function references_ through a single _useComponent_ call which directly calls the function defined in your serverside source code. This means no more HTTP requests or queries which fetch data or perform actions. You instead consume a component which provides the props for your frontend component. Any function reference you render on the server side will automatically be passed to the frontend as callable function which passes all arguments to the serverside function. This allows for seamless two way communication as the serverside response will be sent back to the client resolving the promise.

## Declarative and Modular

React Server has borrowed a few of the concepts from React which makes it possible to design modular backend code in a declarative fashion. Its component driven approach makes it ideal for building complex applications or microservices that work together.

You can easily nest components on the backend and mirror the component structure of the frontend.  
**Note:** This allows you to mitigate the waterfall problem by _precomputing_ all the nested data your frontend components need and send it down to the client in one single response.

## Data transportation

When using serverside components to provide serverside state management and buisiness logic to your frontend components, you don't need to worry about transporting data at all. All that's needed is rendering the component on the _backend_ `<MyComponent key="my-key" />` and a hook on the frontend does the rest `useComponent('my-key)`.

## Components instead of APIs

Instead of consuming REST APIs which maps a given _path_ to a specific functionality, you can now consume **components** all data needed for a component with a single hook.

### React on the backend

Coming from React, you are used to _states_ and `props` on the frontend. Now simply extend that concept to the server side.

A component on the server side is a collection of _states_ (which store your current serverside state), _functions_ (which operate on your states), and a rendered TSX components which describes the _properties_ you expose to the public. You can render any JavaScript value as `props`. Functions get mapped to a serializable representation and passed to the frontend where they can be called with any serializable argument, directly invoking the function of your currently mounted component.

By consuming a component on the frontend (or any other GraphQL client), you get access to all properties rendered by the component. The frontend automatically subscribes to any changes to the component on the serverside so it's properties are always up to date.

Did we mention that a component is simply a function which returns a TSX component? It doesn't get any easier.

## State management

Using _states_ and _effects_ on a component base makes it very easy to build large reactive backend applications. It's easy to break down buisiness logic of a large scale project into multiple components and use states to provide reactive behaviour to parts of its data.
